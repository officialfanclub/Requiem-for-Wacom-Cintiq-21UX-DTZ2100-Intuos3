Requiem-for-Wacom-Cintiq-21UX-DTZ2100-Intuos3

# Why is My Wacom Cintiq DTZ-2100d & Intuos3 Not Working on My Mac?

It is unfortunate that Wacom has decided to drop support for the Cintiq DTZ-2100d and the Intuos3 family of products since Mac High Sierra (OS 10.13).

###  Incompatible Operating Systems

To put it plainly, if your Mac is running **High Sierra** or **Mojave**, your Intuos 3 tablet or Cintiq DTZ-2100d display will no longer work; Wacom has no intention to produce any drivers that will restore any capabilities to your tablet.

## How to get Wacom Cintiq DTZ-2100d or Intuos 3 Tablet running on OSX Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite or Mavericks
How do I know which OS my mac is running?
### Running Mac Sierra (10.12) ?
If you are Mac Sierra, removing any installations of newer Wacom drivers, and installing this older driver should get your Intuos 3 tablet / Cintiq DTZ-2100d functioning as it should.
#### WacomTablet_6.3.11-3a-CINTIQ21UX-DTZ-2100+SIERRA.dmg

#### Instructions:
1. Remove previously install Wacom driver using Wacom Tablet Utility.
2. With your devices NOT plugged in, restart your mac.
3. Install the WacomTablet_6.3.11-3a driver.
4. Restart (for good measure)
5. Your Intuos 3 tablet / Cintiq DTZ-2100d should now work.


### Running Mac Mavericks (10.9), Yosemite (10.10) or El Capitan (10.11)?
I don't have these systems personally, so I have yet to verify this fix. If you try this, let me know how it goes â€”fan.dot.club@gmail.com    

#### WacomTablet_6.3.15-3.dmg

#### Instructions:
1. Remove previously install Wacom driver using Wacom Tablet Utility.
2. With your devices NOT plugged in, restart your mac.

4. Restart (for good measure)
5. Your Intuos 3 tablet / Cintiq DTZ-2100d should now work.

### Decay is Inevitable
I have a 12 x 9in Intuos 3 and a Cintiq DTZ-2100d. It is with great sentimentality that I'm watching Wacom condemn them to obsolescence by way of software. For the utility that I continue get out of these even today, in January of 2019, it does feel like their lives have been abruptly, perhaps prematurely, cut short.  

I hope this little piece of documentation will be useful to others who want to get a bit more use out of their tablets before they are thoroughly alienated from the ecosystem of mainstream software.

Good luck.
